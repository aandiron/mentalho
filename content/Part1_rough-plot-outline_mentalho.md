Mental Whore
----------------------------------------
* She is out for dinner with her friend. He is her friend's new bf
	* He has been charming and flity, but in an innocent way that doesn't leave her friend feeling left out
	* Her friend goes to the bathroom
	* He says "Can I make you a proposition -- I warn you, it's going to sound weird at first."
	* Hestitantly: "OK..."
	* "I want you to go home tonight, and touch yourself. Make yourself cum. Think of me while you do it. If you do, I'll pay you $100."
	* "Weird at _first_? when does this become not-weird? I'm not a whore you know. I'm married and a mother of 2. 3 if you count my husband's kid from his first marriage."
	* "I know, I know! I'm not trying to make you into a whore. Just give it a shot. You don't have to do anything for me in return, other than tell me you did it. And... it's an open offer. The choice is entirely up to you. If you don't want to, well, OK. But if you do, the money is waiting for you. Just let me know when."
* At home that night, wiating for her husband to come home from the bar
	* She starts touching herself. She thinks of the guy. 
	* There's not much feeling there. She is pretty dedicated to her husband, even if he's been kinda boring lately.
	* She thinks about the dude's hands. Thick climber fingers.
	* She's pretty sure he has a nice body. He certainly isn't fat. Or unattractive.
	* She thinks about his cock inside her. But that does nothing.
	* She thinks about his voice. Low and resonant. Whispering in her ear "I want to make you cum"
	* She orgasms.
* The next day she texts him. "Done."
	* The following day an envelop arrives addressed to her with a plain crisp $100 bill in it.
	* And a note that says "any time you do that, I'll send you another $100.
* A week goes by, she's busy with life. But then one night her husband is downstairs working on a project, and she thinks of the man again.
	* She makes herself cum.
* She texts him, and another $100 arrives.
* This goes on for a month or so. Then with one of the bills comes another note.
	* "Make yourself squirt and it's $200."
* That night she does. Texts him "done + sweat drops" $200 arrives the next day.
* She stars masturbating to him every day. Money pours in.
* Her husband fucks her one night, and suddenly the image of the man pops into her head. She goes wild, rodeos him on the couch, cumming hard and soaking wet on her husband's cock. 
	* Her husband notices and asks her what got into her.
* She texts the dude the next day, and more money comes. Plus a note saying the he'll pay her $300 if she can cum anal.
* She does that night, with a vibrator up her ass, laying on the bed feeling "full" while she rubs her pussy until she's cumming so hard it's flowing over her knuckles and she's biting the pillow
* Now she can't cum _without_ thinking about the guy.
* She arranges to fuck him. But when she does, she can't get off.
* She realizes it's not the guy --- it's that she can't cum unless she knows she will be paid!
