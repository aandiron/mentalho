# Working Title: Mental Whore




"Excuse me you two, it's time for me to spend a moment in the WC." my old friend Holly said, rising from the table with its white tablecloth crumb-covered and splatter-painted with the miniscule remains of the meal we had just enjoyed.

"Don't be long! You wouldn't want Athena and I to fall in love while you were in the can. Think of the horror of that!" Owen, Holly's new boyfriend, certainly was charming. He had been doing that the whole evening --- managing to flirt with both me and Holly at the same time. Turning his charm on me without ever making Holly feel slighted. He certainly had a particular kind of social talent. I think a lot of women, probably men too, are suckers for that kind of charisma. I try to remain agnostic and judge the person on their genuine merits, not the charm they turn on at a dinner party. Judging a person fairly requires time to get to know them though. So far, the only chance I've had to interact with Owen was over the last two hours of this meal, and he certainly never turned the charm off.

Physically, he was certainly a pleasure to look at. Tall, though you wouldn't know it while he was seated. Graying at the temples, dressed in a blue well-tailored dress shirt, unbuttoned at the collar. The close fit of the shirt suggested he was a person who worked to keep his body fit --- when his arm closed, his biceps were just large enough to strain against the light cotton of the shirt arms. Normally, I don't go in for that kind of thing. Don't get me wrong: I like an attractive, fit body. But I think if you have to get that by spending half your life in a gym, you are wasting that half of your life. The men I found attractive achieved their fitness just by living -- hard work, or a commitment to a sport they enjoy.

With Owen, it was hard to resist his toothy smile and sharp eyes though. There's all kinds of attractiveness, and then there's the kind of attractive we can all agree on. That was Owen.

"Athena! I need to ask your forgiveness." He said as soon as Holly was out of ear shot.

"What for?" I asked with a little trepidation. "Not the comment about us falling in love? That, my friend, is fucking ridiculous."

"Ha ha! No, not that. I need to ask your forgiveness for something I'm _going_ to do, not something I have done yet."

"I don't like the sound of that..."

"It's really not going to be as big a deal as it sounds. I have a little proposition for you... and you can say no. And if you do say no, then I ask your forgiveness."

"OK... I think I know where this is going." Ugh. Here it comes. He's going to ask for a threesome. It's actually something I would possibly consider --- I've always found Holly attractive in that vague way that's more based on friendship and an absence of disgust rather than the presence of desire. I'd hook up with her, if we were drunk enough to use the drink as an excuse, and if it were something that would make her happy for some reason. But I just _hate_ it when these men think they are so charming and handsome that they just assume they deserve a threesome with two beautiful women. I also just hate the whole _asking_ for a threesome. If it's going to happen it has to just _happen_, not be planned, certified, and documented.

"You think, do you?" He said, smiling. "Here's my proposition: go home tonight and find some time to yourself. Make yourself cum. Make yourself cum thinking about be. It can be me in any way you want me to be, but whatever it is, bring yourself to orgasm _because_ of me. If you do that, I'll pay you $100. Is that what you expected?"

It was not what I expected. 

"Umm. That's an unusual proposition, certainly."

"You were thinking I was going to ask for a threesome? Certainly if that were going to happen, you would be my first choice. But I don't think Holly would appreciate some kind of _planned_ threesome. It has to happen naturally, if it's going to happen, ya know?"

"I know." See? This is what I mean by his charm. It's like he knows what you are thinking --- and clearly I had no idea what he was thinking. "Look, I'm not a prostitute. I'm married! I have two kids. Three if you count the one from my husband's first marriage. You can't just pay me for sexual favors."

"What favor? You don't have to do anything _for_ me. Just think of me while you do it."

"And then you probably want some detailed and explcit report?"

"Nope. Just let me know it's done, and the money is yours."

"Look, that's ridiculous. It's not going to happen. Heck, the threesome was probably more likely."

"OK then. I ask your forgiveness. But if you change your mind, here's my card."

Holly returned from the bathroom just then. I stashed the card quickly so she wouldn't see it.

"You guys miss me?" She asked, slipping into the seat next to Owen and giving him a fresh toungey kiss.

--------------------

A few hours later I was home and in bed, stripped of the pleasant restraint of business-casual evening wear. I was down to just my pale blue panties. The bed spun slightly from the drinks I had with dinner. Pleasantly buzzed, not sickeningly drunk. My husband Mark was downstairs, engrossed in some dense 4-hour documentary news program about the decaying political situation in some foreign land. I call that stuff "vegetable TV" --- because it's like eating vegetables. I liked that stuff when I was in the mood for it, but after a boozy dinner out with friends was not one of those times.

I lay in bed. It had been a warm summer evening out, so the dress I had freed myself from was a light thing, that lay in a panty-matching blue froth on the floor next to the bed. A fan set on low blew cool over my skin. The breeze tickled my exposed nipples in a most pleasant way. 

I thought about Owen and his charm. And his smile. And his proposition.  And I thought: fuck it. Maybe I'll give it a try.

I certainly didn't need the money. But I resolved I would use the money to buy something that I absolutely did not need --- but would give me a little pleasure of my own. Shoes or something. I would spoil myself, or, perhaps it was letting Owen spoil me. Either way, I was in the mood to be spoiled that evening.

I slid my hand down my belly, over the gently curve where my babies had been years ago. I slipped the tip of my fingers under the line of my panties, and slowly, slowly down to my clit. With easy barely-touching, stiff-fingered strokes, I rubbed myself. Just to see if anything was happening, really.

It was going to take more than that though. I wasn't going to cum just thinking about Owen's toothy smile. I thought about his arms. I've always found shapely arms on men a turn-on. I thought about Owen's biscep bulging against his shirt, the way the shirt would strain every time he closed his elbow, or leaned on the table. But it was no good. There simply wasn't enough there to overcome the warm comforting feelings I had towards my husband. 

Those feelings weren't exactly a bend-you-over-and-get-fucked-from-behind-in-public kind of turn-on. We might have had that kind of lust when were first started dating. Who can even remember that long ago though? That feeling of safety and comfort I had with my husband had been the foundation of my sex life for more than 10 years. It wasn't just going to put itself aside and let me have a little no-strings-attached fantasy. Even for a few minutes.

I tried a different tack. I thought about how _wrong_ it was. I _am_ a filthy whore. I'm not doing this for any reason _but_ the money. I wanted Owen's cold cash in my hand, so I'm ignoring my husband and family just to be a little bitch and put my selfish self before all others. 

I said it out loud, though quietly. "I'm such a bad fucking little whore."

That worked. Hearing it for real in the room had the intended effect. My pussy was getting wet against my fingers. Enough that I could hear the slosh of them now as I rubbed them up and down. And that sound just made it more real. A virtuous cycle.

I started to fuck myself harder. I found my clit with the flat end of the tip of my fingers, and rolled around it in circles. I imagined Owen's hands there instead of mine. He had big strong fingers --- climber hands, with the meaty fingers that go along with being able to suspend your weight by your fingers. He was into rock climbing. Did I mention that? He certainly did, at least three times over the course of the evening.

In my head, Owen's fingers now thrust wetly against my clit. It felt very good, and I could imagine getting fucked like this for a long time. But my orgasm was still playing some annoying game of cat-and-mouse, hiding off in some corner somewhere. I needed something else to push me over the edge.

I closed my eyes, and focused on Owen. I brought him into the bed with me. Pressing his body up against me. And then he started whispering in my ear. 

"Athena, your pussy is just lovely. I want your wetness all over my fingers." His voice was soft and deep and resonant. It was all I needed.

My orgasm flooded up and through me. I gasped, sucking in air while trying to remain quiet. I felt my fingers suddenly soaked, still moving easily around my clit. My arm muscles were beginning to ache from rubbing myself, but I almost couldn't even stop.

--------------------

I waited until the next day to text Owen.

Me: It's done.

Owen: Excellent. If you give me your address, I'll mail the money to you.

The following day a small plain envelope with no return address arrived. Inside was a crisp new $100 bill enfolded in a small piece of note paper. In a very square clean hand, entirely in small caps, Owen had written:

_Athena. Holding up my end of the proposition. It also does not end here. Any time you think of me while cumming, let me know and I will send you another one of these bills. Owen._

Well. That was quite the lucrative deal. If he was willing to pay out for nothing but my word that I had done what he asked, who was I to not take in as much running around money as I could?

I thought about the fact that I could just lie to him and _say_ I had cum thinking about him. But somehow --- maybe it was just that sense that he seemed to know what I was thinking at dinner that night --- somehow it seemed like he would know if I lied. I decided I would not lie about it. If I grew uncomfortable with the arrangement, I would simply stop doing it.

For the next week I set aside a little time every night to think about Owen and make myself cum. It quickly got much easier to reach orgasm. A little disconcertingly the hangups from my feelings for my husband seemed to fade away and no longer were much of an obstacle in my quest to find an orgasm with Owen in mind.

This reached a kind of apotheosis a week later when my husband came up to bed in the mood to fuck. We kissed softly for a while, as was our way, and then he started to touch my nipples and pussy. The old familiar sense of safety and comfort was still there, and I could feel myself getting wet, getting ready to take my man in me.

I spread my legs, lifting them up and around his back and that familiar and comforting cock slid into me. I tried to look into his eyes as he entered me, to let him know how much I loved the feeling of him entering into me, but he had his eyes closed as a long, low moan escaped from his lips.

My husband started to fuck me with long, deep, slow strokes. It felt wonderfully. Really. I'm not just saying that. After a whole week of cumming against my fingers, I needed my husband's cock in me.

"Fuck me harder baby. I love having you inside me." I said to him, with as much earnestness as I could put dripping into my voice. He mustered up some more energy and put his back into it, using the full length of his shaft, penetrating right up into me, smacking hard up against my clit.

I rolled him over and got on top of him. I kissed him, and then sat up, running my palms back across his chest as I sank down onto his cock. It was so good to feel that piece rising up inside me, splitting me wide. I started fucking him slowly, rising up and down along his shaft.

And then --- and I'm not really sure how this happened, it wasn't deliberate --- Owen kind of popped into my head. It was his voice again. At least at first. I could hear his low voice whisper in my ear --- some terribly filthy thing about how he wanted his whore to cum, while stuffing a big wad of cash into my small hand.

My pussy soaked.

I closed my eyes, and leaned my head back. And I was fucking my husband, but the truth was I was fucking Owen. I couldn't control myself. I went wild on my husband's cock, rolling my hips forward, sliding my pussy up, and then plunging it back down. I ground my hips back and forth, forcing my clit against my husband's body working it on his form.

My tits were bouncing up and down. I grabbed them, and squeezed my nipples between my fingers. But they were Owen's fingers. Big, meaty, climber fingers relentlessly twisting my nipples. And it was Owen's cock inside me. And now he was cumming inside me, with so much cum I could swear I could feel it gushing in me. 

The thought of Owen's orgasm made me cum too, a screaming loud orgasm that I shouted up at the ceiling while my hips kept grinding away at my husband.

I lost my ability to stay upright and collapsed next to my husband, every muscle trembling. I threw a warm arm across his sweaty chest.

"Jesus Athena. That was fantastic. What got into you?"

"I don't know Mark. Sometimes, you're just in the right mood, you know?"

--------------------

I texted Owen the next day to confirm that I had cum thinking of him again. By coincidence that same day when I opened the envelope that had come with the $100 for the previous day's orgasm, Owen had upped the ante in his note.

_Athena. If you have a soaking wet squirting orgasm while thinking of me, I will pay you $200. It should include penetration._

I was feeling weird about what had happened the previous night with my husband. I decided that this little game had probably gone far enough, and I would ignore this new level to the proposition. I burned the little note and dropped it in a sewer grate.
