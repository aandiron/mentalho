# How to Make a Whore


"Excuse me you two, it's time for me to spend a moment in the WC." my old friend Holly said, rising from the table with its white tablecloth crumb-covered and splatter-painted with the miniscule remains of the meal we had just enjoyed.

"Don't be long! You wouldn't want Athena and I to fall in love while you were in the can. Think of the horror of that!" Owen, Holly's new boyfriend, certainly was charming. He had been doing that the whole evening --- managing to flirt with both me and Holly at the same time. Turning his charm on me without ever making Holly feel slighted. He certainly had a particular kind of social talent. I think a lot of women, probably men too, are suckers for that kind of charisma. I try to remain agnostic and judge the person on their genuine merits, not the charm they turn on at a dinner party. Judging a person fairly requires time to get to know them though. So far, the only chance I've had to interact with Owen was over the last two hours of this meal, and he certainly never turned the charm off.

Physically, he was certainly a pleasure to look at. Tall, though you wouldn't know it while he was seated. Graying at the temples, dressed in a blue well-tailored dress shirt, unbuttoned at the collar. The close fit of the shirt suggested he was a person who worked to keep his body fit --- when his arm closed, his biceps were just large enough to strain against the light cotton of the shirt arms. Normally, I don't go in for that kind of thing. Don't get me wrong: I like an attractive, fit body. But I think if you have to get that by spending half your life in a gym, you are wasting that half of your life. The men I found attractive achieved their fitness just by living -- hard work, or a commitment to a sport they enjoy.

With Owen, it was hard to resist his toothy smile and sharp eyes though. There's all kinds of attractiveness, and then there's the kind of attractive we can all agree on. That was Owen.

"Athena! I need to ask your forgiveness." He said as soon as Holly was out of ear shot.

"What for?" I asked with a little trepidation. "Not the comment about us falling in love? That, my friend, is fucking ridiculous."

"Ha ha! No, not that. I need to ask your forgiveness for something I'm _going_ to do, not something I have done yet."

"I don't like the sound of that..."

"It's really not going to be as big a deal as it sounds. I have a little proposition for you... and you can say no. And if you do say no, then I ask your forgiveness."

"OK... I think I know where this is going." Ugh. Here it comes. He's going to ask for a threesome. It's actually something I would possibly consider --- I've always found Holly attractive in that vague way that's more based on friendship and an absence of disgust rather than the presence of desire. I'd hook up with her, if we were drunk enough to use the drink as an excuse, and if it were something that would make her happy for some reason. But I just _hate_ it when these men think they are so charming and handsome that they just assume they deserve a threesome with two beautiful women. I also just hate the whole _asking_ for a threesome. If it's going to happen it has to just _happen_, not be planned, certified, and documented.

"You think, do you?" He said, smiling. "Here's my proposition: go home tonight and find some time to yourself. Make yourself cum. Make yourself cum thinking about be. It can be me in any way you want me to be, but whatever it is, bring yourself to orgasm _because_ of me. If you do that, I'll pay you $100. Is that what you expected?"

It was not what I expected. 

"Umm. That's an unusual proposition, certainly."

"You were thinking I was going to ask for a threesome? Certainly if that were going to happen, you would be my first choice. But I don't think Holly would appreciate some kind of _planned_ threesome. It has to happen naturally, if it's going to happen, ya know?"

"I know." See? This is what I mean by his charm. It's like he knows what you are thinking --- and clearly I had no idea what he was thinking. "Look, I'm not a prostitute. I'm married! I have two kids. Three if you count the one from my husband's first marriage. You can't just pay me for sexual favors."

"What favor? You don't have to do anything _for_ me. Just think of me while you do it."

"And then you probably want some detailed and explcit report?"

"Nope. Just let me know it's done, and the money is yours."

"Look, that's ridiculous. It's not going to happen. Heck, the threesome was probably more likely."

"OK then. I ask your forgiveness. But if you change your mind, here's my card."

Holly returned from the bathroom just then. I stashed the card quickly so she wouldn't see it.

"You guys miss me?" She asked, slipping into the seat next to Owen and giving him a fresh toungey kiss.

--------------------

A few hours later I was home and in bed, stripped of the pleasant restraint of business-casual evening wear. I was down to just my pale blue panties. The bed spun slightly from the drinks I had with dinner. Pleasantly buzzed, not sickeningly drunk. My husband Mark was downstairs, engrossed in some dense 4-hour documentary news program about the decaying political situation in some foreign land. I call that stuff "vegetable TV" --- because it's like eating vegetables. I liked that stuff when I was in the mood for it, but after a boozy dinner out with friends was not one of those times.

I lay in bed. It had been a warm summer evening out, so the dress I had freed myself from was a light thing, that lay in a panty-matching blue froth on the floor next to the bed. A fan set on low blew cool over my skin. The breeze tickled my exposed nipples in a most pleasant way. 

I thought about Owen and his charm. And his smile. And his proposition.  And I thought: fuck it. Maybe I'll give it a try.

I certainly didn't need the money. But I resolved I would use the money to buy something that I absolutely did not need --- but would give me a little pleasure of my own. Shoes or something. I would spoil myself, or, perhaps it was letting Owen spoil me. Either way, I was in the mood to be spoiled that evening.

I slid my hand down my belly, over the gently curve where my babies had been years ago. I slipped the tip of my fingers under the line of my panties, and slowly, slowly down to my clit. With easy barely-touching, stiff-fingered strokes, I rubbed myself. Just to see if anything was happening, really.

It was going to take more than that though. I wasn't going to cum just thinking about Owen's toothy smile. I thought about his arms. I've always found shapely arms on men a turn-on. I thought about Owen's biscep bulging against his shirt, the way the shirt would strain every time he closed his elbow, or leaned on the table. But it was no good. There simply wasn't enough there to overcome the warm comforting feelings I had towards my husband. 

Those feelings weren't exactly a bend-you-over-and-get-fucked-from-behind-in-public kind of turn-on. We might have had that kind of lust when were first started dating. Who can even remember that long ago though? That feeling of safety and comfort I had with my husband had been the foundation of my sex life for more than 10 years. It wasn't just going to put itself aside and let me have a little no-strings-attached fantasy. Even for a few minutes.

I tried a different tack. I thought about how _wrong_ it was. I _am_ a filthy whore. I'm not doing this for any reason _but_ the money. I wanted Owen's cold cash in my hand, so I'm ignoring my husband and family just to be a little bitch and put my selfish self before all others. 

I said it out loud, though quietly. "I'm such a bad fucking little whore."

That worked. Hearing it for real in the room had the intended effect. My pussy was getting wet against my fingers. Enough that I could hear the slosh of them now as I rubbed them up and down. And that sound just made it more real. A virtuous cycle.

I started to fuck myself harder. I found my clit with the flat end of the tip of my fingers, and rolled around it in circles. I imagined Owen's hands there instead of mine. He had big strong fingers --- climber hands, with the meaty fingers that go along with being able to suspend your weight by your fingers. He was into rock climbing. Did I mention that? He certainly did, at least three times over the course of the evening.

In my head, Owen's fingers now thrust wetly against my clit. It felt very good, and I could imagine getting fucked like this for a long time. But my orgasm was still playing some annoying game of cat-and-mouse, hiding off in some corner somewhere. I needed something else to push me over the edge.

I closed my eyes, and focused on Owen. I brought him into the bed with me. Pressing his body up against me. And then he started whispering in my ear. 

"Athena, your pussy is just lovely. I want your wetness all over my fingers." His voice was soft and deep and resonant. It was all I needed.

My orgasm flooded up and through me. I gasped, sucking in air while trying to remain quiet. I felt my fingers suddenly soaked, still moving easily around my clit. My arm muscles were beginning to ache from rubbing myself, but I almost couldn't even stop.

--------------------

I waited until the next day to text Owen.

Me: It's done.

Owen: Excellent. If you give me your address, I'll mail the money to you.

The following day a small plain envelope with no return address arrived. Inside was a crisp new $100 bill enfolded in a small piece of note paper. In a very square clean hand, entirely in small caps, Owen had written:

_Athena. Holding up my end of the proposition. It also does not end here. Any time you think of me while cumming, let me know and I will send you another one of these bills. Owen._

Well. That was quite the lucrative deal. If he was willing to pay out for nothing but my word that I had done what he asked, who was I to not take in as much running around money as I could?

I thought about the fact that I could just lie to him and _say_ I had cum thinking about him. But somehow --- maybe it was just that sense that he seemed to know what I was thinking at dinner that night --- somehow it seemed like he would know if I lied. I decided I would not lie about it. If I grew uncomfortable with the arrangement, I would simply stop doing it.

For the next week I set aside a little time every night to think about Owen and make myself cum. It quickly got much easier to reach orgasm. A little disconcertingly the hangups from my feelings for my husband seemed to fade away and no longer were much of an obstacle in my quest to find an orgasm with Owen in mind.

This reached a kind of apotheosis a week later when my husband came up to bed in the mood to fuck. We kissed softly for a while, as was our way, and then he started to touch my nipples and pussy. The old familiar sense of safety and comfort was still there, and I could feel myself getting wet, getting ready to take my man in me.

I spread my legs, lifting them up and around his back and that familiar and comforting cock slid into me. I tried to look into his eyes as he entered me, to let him know how much I loved the feeling of him entering into me, but he had his eyes closed as a long, low moan escaped from his lips.

My husband started to fuck me with long, deep, slow strokes. It felt wonderfully. Really. I'm not just saying that. After a whole week of cumming against my fingers, I needed my husband's cock in me.

"Fuck me harder baby. I love having you inside me." I said to him, with as much earnestness as I could put dripping into my voice. He mustered up some more energy and put his back into it, using the full length of his shaft, penetrating right up into me, smacking hard up against my clit.

I rolled him over and got on top of him. I kissed him, and then sat up, running my palms back across his chest as I sank down onto his cock. It was so good to feel that piece rising up inside me, splitting me wide. I started fucking him slowly, rising up and down along his shaft.

And then --- and I'm not really sure how this happened, it wasn't deliberate --- Owen kind of popped into my head. It was his voice again. At least at first. I could hear his low voice whisper in my ear --- some terribly filthy thing about how he wanted his whore to cum, while stuffing a big wad of cash into my small hand.

My pussy soaked.

I closed my eyes, and leaned my head back. And I was fucking my husband, but the truth was I was fucking Owen. I couldn't control myself. I went wild on my husband's cock, rolling my hips forward, sliding my pussy up, and then plunging it back down. I ground my hips back and forth, forcing my clit against my husband's body working it on his form.

My tits were bouncing up and down. I grabbed them, and squeezed my nipples between my fingers. But they were Owen's fingers. Big, meaty, climber fingers relentlessly twisting my nipples. And it was Owen's cock inside me. And now he was cumming inside me, with so much cum I could swear I could feel it gushing in me. 

The thought of Owen's orgasm made me cum too, a screaming loud orgasm that I shouted up at the ceiling while my hips kept grinding away at my husband.

I lost my ability to stay upright and collapsed next to my husband, every muscle trembling. I threw a warm arm across his sweaty chest.

"Jesus Athena. That was fantastic. What got into you?"

"I don't know Mark. Sometimes, you're just in the right mood, you know?"

--------------------

I texted Owen the next day to confirm that I had orgasmed thinking of him again. By coincidence that same day when I opened the envelope that had come with the $100 for the previous day's orgasm, Owen had upped the ante in his note.

_Athena. If you have a soaking wet squirting orgasm while thinking of me, I will pay you $200._

I was feeling weird about what had happened the previous night with my husband. I decided that this little game had probably gone far enough, and I would ignore this new level to the proposition. I burned the little note and dropped it in a sewer grate.

That night I did nothing of a sexual nature. I kissed Mark and went to sleep fairly early with a satisfied conscience. But if I'm being honest with myself, I have to admit that in recent years my libido has been steadily increasing. I find myself horny all the time! I suspect this is what it must be something like what it is like to be an 18 year old boy. I feel some sympathy for those poor kids. How does anyone get anything done when there's sex to be had?

At work the next day I was entirely distracted. Not by any particular thing, just in that way that I really wanted to get fucked, and so anything that reminded me of that drew my attention away from what I was supposed to be working on. I couldn't take my eyes off men in suits that I passed on my walk into the office. And the curve of my coworker's ass in a fine black wool pair of slacks set me back half an hour. Even when my assistant came in and leaned over a bit when she handed me a proof to review --- and I could see the swelling curve down her low-cut dress as if she wanted to tempt me to look there --- even that, though not exactly sexually stimulating for me, left me thinking of how much some dude would like to jizz all over those nice plump tits.

By the time I got home, I was kind of a mess. It felt like the day was missing something, and I realized after dinner that it was not receiving an envelope with money in it from Owen. I had got one every day the preceding week. But I knew I shouldn't have expected one since I had not texted Owen the day before. No work, no pay.

As soon as I got the kids fed and off watching TV or playing video games for the evening, I cornered Mark in our bedroom, and pushed him to sit on the bed. Not even bothering with niceties like kissing, I dropped straight to my knees and hurriedly unzipped his pants and took out his swelling cock.

He leaned back with a dumb grin on his face.

I took the head of his cock in my mouth and quickly got it slobberingly wet. I didn't look up at him while I sucked him in as deep as I could. I only used my mouth because at the same time I was slipping my panties down under the blue A-line dress I had wore to work that day.

With my panties down to my knees, I kept sliding my lips up and down my husband's cock while I fingered my pussy with one hand. With my free hand I groped blindly in the bedside drawer for my vibrator. It was a smallish and light-blue. The silicon type, with a nice little curve at the end. I desperately got it turned on and between my legs. With a groan stifled by Mark's cock, I pressed this quakey little pleasure up against my clit. This finally gave me a free hand to grab Mark's cock at the base. I started stroking him from the bottom, and continuing the stroke up the shaft with my lips right to the tip --- before plunging back down to almost gag-depth.

Now, I like to use my vibrator when I give my husband a blow job. It's a regular part of our lovemaking. I like to cum with his cock in my mouth, preferably at the same time he floods my mouth. But normally, I just rub it a bit against my clit. That's all it takes to make me cum when I've got his lovely, comforting cock in my mouth.

But on this occasion, I subtly twisted that little vibe around, and slipped it up inside my pussy. I closed my eyes, and suddenly I wasn't just sucking off my husband, I was getting fucked by Owen from behind as well. The two men were fucking me from each end. I was turning slowly on a stick over a steaming fire.

Owen pushed into me from behind, and his thrust drove me down my husband's cock until I was lightly choking. I pushed back hard against Owen, and he retreated. My pussy liquefied and melted, hot gobs of fat dripping off and burting into bright shooting-star flames on their way down, to be consumed before they hit the smoldering earth.

I came.

My pussy clenched around my vibrator which was Owen's cock. I rolled my hips forward involuntarily. The motion of it forced by whole body forward and I went down hard on Mark's cock. He came at then too. I felt myself explode, and liquid gushed out all over my fingers and soaked the inside of my thighs. At the same time Mark's cum washed down my throat, like the liquid was coming into a retention pond and raising the level until it poured over the retaining wall.

And I knew if Owen had really been in my pussy, he too would have been orgasming at that same moment. No man would be able to resist that rolling, clenching, gushing little cauldron.

--------------------

The next morning, the first thing I did when I woke up was text Owen again:

Me: Done. 💦💦

The following day, the small envelope I was craving arrived, with two crisp, new $100 bills in it this time. They were wrapped in another note upping the ante once again:

_Athena. I appreciate all the fine work you are doing for me. That is why I am giving you yet more responsibility. Make yourself orgasm while thinking of me fucking you in the ass, and I will pay you $300. Owen._

By this time, I was completely lost in the churning machine that was Owen's mind. That evening during my alone time, I got my trusty little vibrator out, and turned it to it's highest setting. I lubed it, and slid it slowly up my ass. And then I lay face down on the bed, with my little friend buzzing deep inside me. I fingered my pussy and thought about Owen being over me, his cock filling me up. Making me feel so completely full of him.

I came biting my pillow and stifling my moans while my body writhed uncontrollably against the cotton quilt of the bedspread.

And as if Owen's machine made one more revolution, the next morning I texted him again:

Me: 🍑 Done. 

And then I went into work.

But at work, I again spent the day distracted. And this time, it was not by random things, but by very specific, very dirty thoughts about the man Owen himself. I couldn't keep him out of my mind. I realized I needed to fuck him for real.

Late in the afternoon, I texted him:

Me: I think I need to see you tonight. Is that possible?

Owen: Surely. Meet me at that same place we had dinner with Holly. Around 8?

Me: Thank you. I mean it.

I then texted some totally thin excuse for why I would be home late to my husband.

I got out of work with plenty of time to make it to the restaurant. At 8pm had been sitting at the bar for about an hour, nursing a cocktail and trying to look sexy, but not too eager. Owen came in promptly at 8pm --- he was a gentleman, not a rock star. He was not going to make his fans wait for it with some lame notion of building anticipation. On the other hand, he didn't look rushed either. He stepped into the restaurant and casually checked his phone for a few minutes before looking up and catching my eye.

He smiled that toothy smile of his and came over and sat down next to me, brushing his leg against mine as he slipped into the narrow gap between bar stools. He looked better than I remembered, possibly because he was dressed in a dark finely-cut suit this time. Though it was also possible I had simply forgotten how attractive he was. Remember: I only met this guy once before and haven't seen or spoken to him in more than a week.

"Athena. I honestly did not expect to see you again. Even with our little game."

"Little game? You mean your devious and calculated plan?"

"Do I need to ask for your forgiveness?"

"What I need from you is a release."

"Oh really?"

"I mean a release from this contract, or whatever you want to call it. I can't hold up my end anymore. It's interfering with my life."

"Ha. Forgive me for that. But a contract is a two-way thing. You could end it any time you want."

"Really... I can't." I lifted my eyes to his at that moment and those razor eyes of his were already seeking mine. I gave up at that moment.

Twenty minutes later we had abandoned half-finished drinks at the bar, and gotten a room in the hotel above the restaurant. I pushed him quickly into the room, and started stripping his suit off him; pulling the jacket back by the sleeves, loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt. All this the interstitial action between long sloppy wet kisses.

The room was high up, maybe 10 stories. It had those big floor-to-ceiling windows that seem to be mandatory in luxury hotel rooms. It looked out on a lovely view of the other buildings between there and the river. We left the lights on. Anyone in any of those office buildings or residential towers would be able to see us.

I pushed him back on the bed and got on top of him. I kissed him for a while, and then leaned back and rolled my hips, grinding my pussy against the bulge in his pants.

But... something wasn't quite right. I wasn't as turned on as I thought I would be. For a moment I thought maybe it was that sense of wrongness of cheating on my husband that was mentally getting in the way of what my body wanted. But I took a moment to think about that and decided no, that wasn't it. I had put that aside a week ago.

I slowed my grinding down, breathing heavily.

Owen look up at me. "What's wrong?"

"I'm... not sure."

I slowly got off him, and lowered my self to my knees on the edge of the bed. I unzipped his pants and look out his long lovely soft-skinned, hard-souled cock. I put my lips on it, and started to suck him gently. I put on hand down my panties. I was hardly wet at all.

I lifted my head, stroking his big cock with my little hand slowly while I looked at him with a sigh escaping.

"What? What is it? Do you feel guilty or something?"

I closed my eyes, and searched my feelings.

Fuck.

"Fuck. I do know what it is."

"What?"

"Before I get turned on, before I get wet for you, I need to know you are going to fucking pay me. You motherfucker. You totally made me your fucking whore!"
