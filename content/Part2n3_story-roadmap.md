# How to make a whore --- story roadmap for Parts 2 and 3


## Part 2
The best idea I've got is to run with this concept that she _thinks_ its about
the sex, but actually it's about the money. Chapter 2 is her sorting this out:
trying various paid sex acts, but slowly discovering that she's not really
turned on by being a whore, she's turned on by making money.
* "My life turned some kind of corner that night that I realized I needed Owen to pay me before I could get off."
* "All the parameters that I thought I understood about my sex life shifted. In some ways it was like being young again -- Owen's little game had broken all my preconceptions about sex and now I needed to rediscover what it was that turned me on."
* She arranges to meet Owen again. She insists he pay her first before they have sex.
	* Owen goes along with it, but after confesses that he is not a john. He doesn't need to pay for sex. His plan was to get her addicted to him, and it seems like it sort of backfired by turning her into a whore. That wasn't what he was going for.
	* But, he's good-natured about it. If that's what she wants, (it is, she says, she finds she likes the idea of being paid for sex) he has a friend who handles that kind of business.
* She meets the pimp:
	* "So you're a pimp?"
		* (need a name for this dude)
	* "Jesus fuck, where do these fucking women come from?" He says, looking up in supplication at the ceiling. "I am in logistics. I make sure that what is needed arrives at the place it's needed at the proper fucking time. Don't ever call me a pimp. Pimps work on the street level. I am a fucking CEO."
		* "We get women like you from time to time. Attractive, fucking mid-life crisis women who are discovering new things about themselves, or at least want to test themselves. Honestly your type is often more trouble than it's worth. You have annoying fucking demands and expectations. It's very fucking un-professional really. On the other hand I have a number of clients who are looking for exactly what you can offer: some perfect blend of motherhood and slut. But first you have to pass a fucking employment exam."
		* He unzips his pants and slips them down. He's the type that's skinny with a very large cock. Why does that seem to happen? It some weird thing about cocks that unlike all other body parts there seems to be no rule about how they are proportioned relative to the size of the person who possesses them.
		* He makes her suck his cock -- it's a rough, tough, hard blowjob. She's gagging and he's got her hand on the back of her head and forcing it down her throat. Her eyes water. He calls her a fucking wanna-be slut. Be a fucking professional!
		* Look, you can't just suck cock if you want to go pro. You need to be able to make yourself cum at the same time if that's what the customer wants. This is your entrance exam. I'm the customer. That's what I fucking want -- make yourself cum.
		* She touches herself, but nothing happens. She tries to focus on cumming. But it's not there.
		* She thinks about the money she could earn, and she feels herself get wet.
		* She forces her head off his cock, and gasping, with spit falling from her lower lip in a long string she says, "the money. pay me the money, and I'll cum for you."
		* "Ha! Now, that's fucking unusual. You really _are_ a fucking little whore, aren't you? Alright." He strips off 3 $100 bills and stuffs them into her hand.
		* She cums almost immediately.
		* He is well satisfied. "Well, that's a kink I think I can work with."
* The pimp sets her up with a man-mountain, shaved head (scene from debauchery more or less -- might as well admit there's some influence here)
	* He fucks her hard, like a fucking hurricane smashing into her.
	* She's never felt so powerless, but that hardly does anything for her orgasm.
	* At some point she's close to the money stacked on the sideboard, and she takes it and holds it against her chest while he fucks her. She cums.
* She gives 60% to the pimp. This makes her angry and turns her off.
* (Part 3 could start here if you are already at 5k words)
* Pimp sets her up for a threesome --- double the money
	* When she arrives, surprise! It's Holly!
	* The man is an older gentleman, in late 60's
		* "When you have been around as long as I have, when you have led a life like I did, you begin to feel like you've tried everything. It's frustrating because the sex drive is still there, but I find that I need fresher, more illicit things to really be turned on. A threesome is kind of the minimum for me to get off these days. It's the price of hedonism and a surfeit of resources, I suppose, some human need to always experience the new."
	* "I want to watch you two get off on each other"
		* Holly is kinda into it. Athena needs to be paid, and then suddenly finds she is attracted to Holly.
		* She cums with Holly.
		* And the old guy. She cums on his cock.



## Part 3
In the 3rd chapter, she is sleeping with some high-powered finance bro _just_
to get an illegal stock tip. And then maybe it ends with her masturbating while
watching her illicit stock portfolio climb and climb.
* Banker friend of the old guy from the threesome? Younger though maybe? Who cares.
