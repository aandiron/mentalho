# How To Make a Whore, Part 2
A turn for the worse.


That night in the hotel room with Owen was the night that my life turned some sort of corner. Everything that I thought I had understood about my own sex life --- what turned me on, what was important to me in a relationship, what actions someone needed to take in order to make me cum --- it all fell apart. My sexual heuristics that had been so reliable since I was a teenager now failed me. It was, actually, quite a bit like being young again: Owen's stupid little game had broken down the edifice of everything I thought I knew about my own sex life and left me, in the middle of my life, desperately flailing around, experimenting, trying to figure out just what it was that led me to sexual satisfaction.

I felt confused, if nothing else.

Oh, maybe I'm getting a little ahead of myself and I should fill you in on the rest of that night with Owen first. He had laughed at me when I told him he had made me his whore. Then he fumbled in the pocket of his loose pants and came up with a $100 bill, as if he had been holding it in reserve for me already. He 
slipped the folded bill between my breasts. The feel of the rough cotton paper of the money against the sensitive skin between my breasts was heaven. My pussy immediately responded.

But I found the wave of competing sensory inputs stirring the confusion of my thoughts. I touched my pussy as I picked up sucking his dick, and I probably could have even made myself cum, but really I was just ready to leave. I sucked him until his cum flooded my mouth. I lifted my head, pulling my hair back with one hand, and look to the ceiling as I swallowed his cum.

I took a deep breath and looked at him. "I have to go." I said.

He looked confused, and a little upset. But I think he knew I was having some kind of existential crisis. He pulled his pants up, and helped me get my things together. He followed me to the hotel door and gave me a tender kiss.

"For what it's worth, I think you would be an excellent whore." He said with his toothy smile.

I smiled back at him half-heartedly and left.

For the next week, I focused on my work and family. I didn't think about Owen at all, and I was beginning to believe I had put this silly little episode behind me. I didn't know this little "episode" had all just been a small corner-mirror glimpse around the vertex my life was about to pivot about.

The problem was the shoes. As planned, I had spent the bit of money I had "earned" from Owen on shoes: Blahnik pumps that managed to be both professional and steamy-looking at the same time.

I wore them to the office one day, a couple of weeks after that last evening with Owen. During a particularly hectic part of the day --- when I was in back-to-back meetings, I looked down at those shoes and admired how they looked on my feet, and the way they made the arc of my lower leg look sexy. And I thought: fuck me, I want more of that in my life. Meaning not just the shoes, but the whole process that had led to the shoes. I needed the excitement of _earning_ those shoes. I decided I would reach out to Owen again and see if I could work some more more cash out of him. I texted him right there in the meeting and arranged to meet him that evening, same hotel as last time. I texted my husband to tell him I would be late again.

When he walked into the hotel restaurant that evening, it was a _deja vu_ experience of last time. He was wearing a similar dark suit and tie. I probably did not look quite as good, as I had not anticipated the evening taking this turn: I was wearing a fairly unremarkable poly/cotton black dress. But I did have those Blahnik pumps on! The nice thing about sitting in a bar stool is it showed off my feet and legs.

"Nice to see you again Athena. Seems like every time you contact me now it breaks my expectation that the previous encounter was the final one."

I put my hand out and touched his big chest with my fingers as he slipped into the seat next to me. "Well, maybe your little plan worked better than even you thought it did. Maybe I'm totally addicted to you now. Maybe I need you to cum." I looked him in the eye as I said that.

This little gesture seemed to cut through his charm a little, I could swear I saw him blush a little. ...Who am I fooling? That little blush just enhanced his charm.

"Look," he said, "I'm genuinely glad to see you again. But I also sense some tension here --- I don't want to be a hassle in your life, the whole point of the game was just that I thought it would be fun to own a little piece of your fantasies. If this has become some thing where you are thinking about leaving your husband..."

"Fuck you Owen. My relationship with Mark is my responsibility and I can take care of myself." I smiled and let the tips of my fingers side along the top of his thigh. "I didn't contact you because I'm tormented. I contacted you because I need to get fucked. By you."
