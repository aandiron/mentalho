# How To Make a Whore, Part 2
A turn for the worse.


That night in the hotel room with Owen was the night that my life turned some sort of corner. Everything that I thought I had understood about my own sex life --- what turned me on, what was important to me in a relationship, what actions someone needed to take in order to make me cum --- it all fell apart. My sexual heuristics that had been so reliable since I was a teenager now failed me. It was, actually, quite a bit like being young again: Owen's stupid little game had broken down the edifice of everything I thought I knew about my own sex life and left me, in the middle of my life, desperately flailing around, experimenting, and trying to figure out just what it was that led me to sexual satisfaction.

I felt confused, if nothing else.

Oh, maybe I'm getting a little ahead of myself and I should fill you in on the rest of that night with Owen first. He had laughed at me when I told him he had made me his whore. Then he fumbled in the pocket of his loose pants and came up with a $100 bill, as if he had been holding it in reserve for me already. He 
slipped the folded bill between my breasts. The feel of the rough cotton paper of the money against the sensitive skin between my breasts was heaven. My pussy immediately responded.

But I found the wave of competing sensory inputs stirring the confusion of my thoughts. I touched my pussy as I resumed sucking his dick, and I probably could have even made myself cum if I had put some effort into it, but really I was just ready to leave. I sucked him until his cum flooded my mouth. I lifted my head, pulling my hair back with one hand, and looked to the ceiling as I swallowed his cum.

I took a deep breath and caught his eye. "I have to go." I said.

He looked confused, and a little upset. But I think he could sense I was having some kind of existential crisis. He pulled his pants up, and helped me get my things together. He followed me to the hotel door and gave me a tender kiss.

"For what it's worth, I think you would be an excellent whore." He said with his toothy smile.

I smiled back at him half-heartedly and left.

For the next week, I focused on my work and family. I didn't think about Owen at all, and I was beginning to believe I had put this silly little episode behind me. I didn't know this little "episode" had all just been a small corner-mirror glimpse around the vertex my life was about to pivot around.

The problem was the shoes. As planned, I had spent the bit of money I had "earned" from Owen on shoes: Blahnik pumps that managed to be both professional and steamy-looking at the same time.

I wore them to the office one day, a couple of weeks after that last evening with Owen. During a particularly hectic part of the day --- when I was in back-to-back meetings, I looked down at those shoes and admired how they looked on my feet, and the way they made the arc of my lower leg look sexy. And I thought: fuck me, I want more of that in my life. Meaning not just the shoes, but the whole exciting mini-adventure that had led to the shoes. I needed the excitement of _earning_ those shoes. I decided I would reach out to Owen again and see if I could work some more more cash out of him. I texted him right there in the meeting and arranged to meet him that evening, at the same hotel as last time. I texted my husband to tell him I would be late again.

When Owen walked into the hotel restaurant, it was a _deja vu_ experience of last time. He was wearing a similar dark suit and tie. I probably did not look quite as good, as I had not anticipated the evening taking this turn: I was wearing a fairly unremarkable poly/cotton black dress. But I did have those Blahnik pumps on! The nice thing about sitting in a bar stool is it showed off my feet and legs.

"Nice to see you again Athena. Seems like every time you contact me now it breaks my conviction that the previous encounter was the final one."

I put my hand out and touched his big chest with my fingers as he slipped into the seat next to me. "Well, maybe your little plan worked better than even you thought it did. Maybe I'm totally addicted to you now. Maybe I need you when I want to cum." I looked him in the eye as I said that.

This little gesture seemed to cut through his charm a little, I could swear I saw him blush. ...But who am I fooling? That little blush just enhanced his charm.

"Look," he said, "I'm genuinely glad to see you again. But I also sense some tension here --- I don't want to be a hassle in your life, the whole point of the game was just that I thought it would be fun to own a little piece of your fantasies. If this has become some thing where you are thinking about leaving your husband..."

"Fuck you Owen. My relationship with Mark is my responsibility and I can take care of myself." I smiled and let the tips of my fingers side along the top of his thigh. "I didn't contact you because I'm tormented. I contacted you because I need to get fucked. By you."

"OK... I suppose I can accommodate that." He smiled casually at me.

"Well, come on!" I held up the room key card. "I haven't got all night." 

I never even gave him an opportunity to get a drink. I took his big hand and pulled him towards the elevator. We found the room, a mirror image of the room from last time. It faced out the opposite of the building, with the same floor-to-ceiling windows but on the opposite side of the bed. I turned the lights out, and stood at the window looking out at the dark city lit up from below with uncountable twinkling little lights like fireflies in a field.

Owen came up behind me and put his arms around me. He pulled my hair back with one hand and started kissing my neck.

"Aren't you forgetting something?" I asked.

"Ha! Oh right." I didn't turn around, but I could hear him pull his wallet from his pants and withdrew a crisp bill. His hands went down and then lifted my dress above my waist. He stuck the bill into the waistline of my panties.

As he did I slid my hand down the front of my panties, and almost in time with the bill touching my skin I could feel my pussy soaking against the tips of my fingers.

I bent over in front of him, and hooked my thumbs into my panties. As I slipped them over my ass and down my legs, I made sure to take the bill into my fingers.
Another $100 bill. It seemed odd to me how much clean, high-denomination cash this dude carried.

I put both of my hands against the glass, the bill still clutched in my left hand. I looked back over my shoulder and made sure he was looking at my ass, and my lovely pussy peaking out between my legs --- and not the vista of the city beyond the window.

He was a good boy. His eyes were locked on my ass. I could see the bulge in slacks too. He opened his hands and started to reach for my curves.

"Nope!"

"Nope?"

"No. If you want to touch, it's going to cost more."

He laughed again, though this time I thought perhaps it was more of a good-natured sociable laugh than one suggesting he was entertained by my antics. He fished his wallet back out of his pants, and pulled out another $100. He waved it around like he was looking for an enticing way to lay it on my ass or something. I didn't let him get that far. I snatched the bill from him and held it in my fist with the other.

"OK. Touch my pussy." I leaned further over against the window and raised my hips into the air.

I felt his fingertips touch the inside of my thigh, and travel slowly upwards until they were dipping into my pussy.

"You're so wet!" He exclaimed.

"Put your fingers inside me."

Thick and strong they flowed up into me. He clamped my cunt in his big hand and finger-fucked me with a couple of fingers while simultaneously rubbing my clit with his other fingers.

I tightened my fist around the bills, and ground my hips up and down on his fingers. I started to cum."

"I want to fuck you Athena. I want to put my cock inside you."

"$500."

"What if I don't have that kind of cash?"

"Then you can go home and jack off to the picture of my ass in your head. You want this tight, wet cunt on your cock, you better have cash."

He sighed, only half-jokingly, and withdrew 5 more bills from his wallet. Seeing he had good intentions, I pulled my dress up over my head. I slowly undid my bra and let my breasts out into the cool hotel room air. My nipples appreciated that, and so did Owen. I know what you're going to say: I should have charged him for that. I was, after all, essentially doing a strip tease for him. That should have been monetizable. But he was being a good client. You have to take care of your customers if you want them to take care of you. It can't _all_ be about extraction.

He handed me the bills, and I put them into the pile in my fist. With my other hand I undid his slacks and unthreaded his long cock from them. I stroked it a bit with my warm little hand and then turned back to the window.

I leaned over and looked back at him again. "Come fuck me. Fuck me right in front of this huge city where anyone might see us."
